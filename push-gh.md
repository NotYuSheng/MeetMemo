## Recent Push: Transcript Chunking Improvements

### Branch: `feat/improve-transcript-chunking`
**Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Commit**: `a473a20`  

### Changes Made:
- **File Modified**: `backend/pyannote_whisper/utils.py`
- **Type**: Feature enhancement
- **Lines Changed**: +156, -3

### Git Workflow Used:

1. **Created Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/improve-transcript-chunking
   ```

2. **Staged Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add backend/pyannote_whisper/utils.py
   ```

3. **Committed with Conventional Message**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: improve transcript readability with intelligent segment merging

   - Add recursive merging algorithm to combine short consecutive segments
   - Implement aggressive merging parameters (8s min duration, 4s gap tolerance)
   - Add text cleaning to remove excessive ellipsis and normalize spaces
   - Enhance merge rules with gap-based and duration-based logic
   - Prevent overly long segments with 25-second maximum limit
   - Maintain speaker change boundaries while improving readability

   This dramatically reduces fragmented transcripts from 12+ tiny segments
   to 2-3 readable chunks, improving user experience significantly.

   ```

4. **Pushed to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/improve-transcript-chunking
   ```

### Feature Summary:
**Problem**: Users experienced fragmented transcripts with 12+ tiny segments (1-4 seconds each) for continuous speech, making transcripts hard to read due to excessive "..." and poor chunking logic.

**Solution**: Implemented intelligent merging system with:
- Recursive processing (multiple passes until no more merging possible)
- Aggressive parameters (8-second minimum duration, 4-second gap tolerance)
- Text cleaning (removes excessive ellipsis, normalizes spaces)
- Smart merging rules (considers gaps, duration, punctuation, speaker changes)
- Safety limits (25-second maximum segment length)

**Result**: 83% reduction in segment count (12+ segments â†’ 2-3 readable segments) with dramatically improved readability.
