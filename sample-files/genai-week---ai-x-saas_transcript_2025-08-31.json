So that was our goal from the start to share with you guys some real use case that are based on the experience of these three seasoned entrepreneurs. So let me introduce them very, very quickly before going to the to the question. So you have a little bit of context. So Anant is a Stanford MIT alumni, founder and CEO of Instabase, Seri-T company, 2 billion valuation, 300 employees, and powered Instabase",

So this is Anant. Then we have Ryan from Ascend Lead. So Ryan has his area of continuous knowledge, his AI has applied to modern enterprise for customer support applications. He talked primarily to chief customer officers and support operations leaders. This company founded in 2018, who were AI support agents and work for planning for hundreds of other enterprises, including NC, Robin Hood, and Stripe. And Ryan starts. Ryan is the head of growth at Rising Team, a company helping enterprise organizations like Google Cloud, Airbnb, Cisco, Bizarre. And more help their managers use AI to improve their leadership and develop stronger, more connected tips. So what I really like about this session is that we are going to tackle also the strategic level and not only the band aid of AI. So let's start with Anant. Anant. So you have an extensive experience in the financial industry, but not only government as well. And I'm sure that you have tons of insights to share and use case and learning.

Artistic intelligence plays an important role in automating many of the things that are being done either manually or not being done effectively. Now here's another example. So let's take your bank. When you apply for loan, the reason why they take several days or weeks to process it is because you have a processor, data, and your organizations. And again, you can do a lot of those things",

So our goal is how we can enable these organizations, take these data, process them automatically, and help them make decisions. So the examples could be if JPM wanted to give you a loan in less than 10 minutes, now it is possible that you can do most of the things",

They should not be days and weeks. So that's what we do. Now the question is what we have learned and what are the key insights to share. The key lessons is first. I think I'm very, very bullish on AI. I think AI will play a key role and very important role in fundamentally changing the operational productivity of every single organization, every single industry in the world.

      "text": "Yeah, I think very similar takeaways to what Anon was sharing about workflow automation. I think right now customer service is one of the most obvious. You take the AI camera and you go hit the customer service nail and kind of automate everything away. My background is machine learning. I worked at Stripe on fraud detection, actually. And the reason I'm working in customer service was back when it was ML or big data, even, not AI. It was like, let's go automate this away. And then if you go do that and you go fly and maybe you handle a lot of the trivial, simple tickets, like 20, 30% of that. And then there's still a lot left. And I think everybody has had that experience with customer support. Okay, no, that does not solve my problem. Hit me to a person, like right now, right? So I think it's actually quite nuanced, the deployment in customer service, even with, you know, what's happening with AI is quite different from ML. And, you know, there's like automation of tier one support for sure. There's a lot of productivity gains for tier two and tier three support. Like humans are getting better. You know, co-pilots are making them more productive, taking away toilsome manual work. And then there's also AI in the planning. So some of what Assemble does is like both the AI automation for end consumers, but also DoorDash is one of our customers. They have 15,000 people in the contact center. And there's very deep questions around like how many people should be working, what should they be working on, this kind of like matching of supply and demand. So I actually think like the use case in customer service is quite nuanced and it is this interesting blueprint for the rest of the enterprise too",

      "text": "I'm excited for this conversation. We're really thinking about the operating system and, you know, there's the technical level. There's, you know, how we plan. But then there's a little human level of how we incorporate this technology and also how the workforce has changed. So I know there's a lot of solo entrepreneurs out there, but how many folks in the audience are working on a team? Whether a manager or a team member, right? Who would say it's easier today to work on a team? Who would say it's harder? Yeah, so, you know, a mix of both, but certainly, you know, certainly folks, you know, that don't appreciate how difficult it is. It's always been hard. What's that? It's always been hard. It's always been hard. The truth is it's always been hard and it's getting even harder, right? With, you know, remote work or your team are distributed. Sometimes they're halfway across the globe. You know, many organizations and large enterprises today have also gone through, you know, significant cost-cutting initiatives as well. So, trimmed management layers. And so, you know, the ratio of the manager to team members is actually much higher today. Higher in terms of team members. And so, the, you know, the way then that you lead a team is just very, very difficult. And, you know, really when, you know, for enterprises, you know, the way that they're going to deliver on their strategy and their goals is having really high-performing teams. And there's a lot of science behind, you know, the rationale of having teams that are very highly connected and engaged and how that actually unlocks higher team performance. But, in circumstances where it's really hard today, there's new approaches that are needed. And so, if you're a manager, you want to build a really, you know, deeply connected team. You need to know your teammates. You need to understand, you know, their work preferences. You need to tailor your management style. You know, then doing that for, you know, a global distributed workforce. And with, you know, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your team members. The task is really hard. And so, this is where there's opportunity for, you know, AI to help kind of supercharge a manager. By actually incorporating insights about their team members and personalizing their interactions",

And it's hard for managers to remember details about team members. You might have new folks coming on your team and there to ramp up time. So, this is where there's a lot of opportunity for AI to, you know, empower, empower managers, make them more effective in how they're managing, and then do that at scale. Okay",

      "text": "I'd be curious for other people to weigh on this too. One of the things that we see as friction point is that it's so obvious that customer service should be disrupted by AI that people don't know what to actually do. I was talking, I was in Barcelona two weeks ago talking to actually somebody who was this very sophisticated support leader. She was with DoorDash very early on, now at a company called Snunu. It's a delivery app in the Middle East. It was a billion dollar fundraise out of, I think, Qatar. And she was like, you know, our whole executive team, we know, you've got to have AI. Right now, yesterday. You know, you've got to have it right now. But like, what does that actually mean? And she's like, our whole C-suite, you know, these are senior leaders and we keep hearing about AI. And we don't really have time to come to conferences like this and get deep and understand, like, what's really going on. And it's like, it seems so far away to know how does it actually work, let alone what, you know, what can it actually do. And so in customer service, you've got like every single week there's a new company and they raise a shit ton of money. And then it's like, okay, they do this thing and it's like, does it actually work? You know, what are the results? So the simple thing is like, I think people know that they want AI. They don't know exactly what that means or how to do it, I find. And so like, we've spent a lot of time at Assembled investing in almost like a 201, like not 101 level education, 102 level education, like 201. You know, like the survey of like, okay, but we're going to do a class where we're like, explain to you, like, and not just like networking dinners. Like we're going to get like five executives of customer service together, do a 201 survey of like, okay, here's all the different use cases we've seen. Like pure automation, AI agents for chat, for email, for voice, co-pilots, quality assurance, co-pilot for like workflow automation. Like, okay, here's how it integrates with like RPA too, like robotic process automation. So it's a little bit older all the way into workforce management, forecasting. So like really like giving people the landscape of, okay, these are things that you know about, like use it like specific problems. I mean, here's how it ties to this like firm role. So the full survey, but, but I, I think it really, I mean, again, I'm curious if other people see that. It's like, what is AI actually?",

So what in terms of your learning and latest use case, what do you want to share with us to, to provide value to our audience?",

    {
      "speaker": "Anant Barwaj (CEO)",
      "text": "Yeah, maybe I think it would make sense to take two different perspectives. One, I'll take one technical perspective and second is the business level of policy. So technical perspective, I think if you look at the use of AI, I break that into roughly, I think, four different levels. The first one is if you want to learn people going to JackGPT or cloud and asking some questions, that's the first level of productivity. But if you want to do it on your own data, it would be trained on internet data. So second level, I think, of sophistication. What I've seen is some kind of rag where people connect it with their systems and it will do some retrieval from your stuff and then get your answer. Third level of sophistication that I've seen now work reasonably well in some places is kind of like the tool augmented rag. So you're not just retrieving, but you are taking some actions like query database and pulling stuff from Salesforce and doing those kind of things. But still, I call this like tool augmented draw and drag. And I've seen those people have done some kind of small, small things around these three areas. The next two is much more nuanced, which is, and I think that's what Ryan was talking about, the first number four, which I call AI workflow. Yeah, workflow is a set of steps where AI can assist in those things, but who does the reasoning? Who defines what should happen? And the last one is agentic, which you all must have heard. So I have some controversy to take on the technical part of this, which is, I do not believe that agentics should run in production. And the reason for that is the following. Even if you're running an organization, right, not a human or a support person sitting on the, you know, branch desk or branch table make a decision based on what they think. They don't, right? They make based on defined workflow. They follow the exact set of steps that somebody has to, as your process in the company. Like if you want to, some, you know, person and then steps in and decide whether you should get it out or not, right? They basically go, submit, they run for some things",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Anant Barwaj (CEO)",
      "text": "So I think that the reality is the way I see technically things will get deployed is agentic would play an important role in helping you create these workflows, but then humans would come and decide which steps make sense, which steps do not make sense, which steps require human review, which steps require rejection checks, which steps basically need to be validated in a certain way or whatever. But once that is created, then you have that that generates like more deterministic workflow, which runs in production. Typically, it's always a good idea to take lessons from what has worked well. And I think one tool that I've been reasonably impressed with is some of these coding tools, right? You might have used Cursor or Windsor and some of those, and I use them a lot. But you don't allow agent to go write code and then post in production, right? It didn't work that way. You ask agent to create those, but then you go to it. You make change, you test it and everything looks good. Then you put something that is much more deterministic",

      "text": "So our approach is that agentic AI would be more of build and development time phenomena that will allow you to create a bunch of work projects scale, but runtime phenomena is going to be AI work approach, which would be much more predictable, deterministic, explainable, instrumentable, and so on",

I was thinking, this is just a part of my mind, I was trying to play with the system. Basically, I was looking at how do you get value from computers? The way you get value from computers is by your eyes, you see things clean, and you input things by your hand, right? The mouse and keyboard. And I think that maybe the next most powerful AI would not be based on tokens and those kind of things. It should just see things and operate keyboard and mouse. Because if you can do that, it will give you everything computing as well. So I think that I'm sure that future AI would not look like maybe the current AI the way it looks. If you want to do real agent, then maybe like, this should be replacement of human body models, right? With your hand and fingers that you use for operating the mouse and the keyboard.
