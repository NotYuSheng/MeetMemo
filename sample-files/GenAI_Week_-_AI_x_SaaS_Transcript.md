**Ryan Wong** *(53.76s - 60.80s)*: marketing at Rising Team focused on leadership and team development. We'll have time for questions at

**Ryan Wong** *(60.80s - 65.92s)*: the end of our session so at that time please raise your hand and we will try to get a microphone to you.

**Ryan Wong** *(67.12s - 72.24s)*: Also at this time just a reminder please silence all your devices so that our speakers remain

**Ryan Wong** *(72.24s - 79.76s)*: uninterrupted. Okay now please join me in welcoming our distinguished guests to the stage.

**Ryan Wong** *(83.76s - 101.00s)*: On your far left will be Geraldine, followed by Anand.

**Ryan Wong** *(101.00s - 107.54s)*: Then you have Ryan Wong and Ryan Starks.

**Ryan Wong** *(107.54s - 111.54s)*: Thank you guys for joining us and sharing your wonderful insights today.

**Ryan Wong** *(111.54s - 112.54s)*: Geraldine, over to you.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(112.54s - 113.54s)*: Yes.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(113.54s - 122.66s)*: hi everyone how are you feeling good okay i'm beyond excited to be there with three seasoned

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(122.66s - 133.06s)*: entrepreneurs to tackle one of the most critical and strategic topics in ai so we are going to

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(133.06s - 139.06s)*: talk about workflow optimization leadership management and customer support

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(139.06s - 150.52s)*: from workflow optimization system to leadership customization tools for customers to being

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(150.52s - 159.82s)*: onboarded and learn the specific use case that deliver a ride and avoid how to avoid

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(159.82s - 167.02s)*: the bit holes that can destroy value so we didn't want to have another hype marketing

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(167.02s - 175.74s)*: session here so that was our goal from the start to share with you guys some real use case that

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(176.46s - 184.46s)*: are based on the experience of these three seasoned entrepreneurs so let me introduce them very very

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(184.46s - 191.10s)*: quickly before going to the to the question so you have a little bit of context so annand is a

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(191.10s - 195.42s)*: Stanford MIT alumni for the CEO of Instabase,

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(195.42s - 201.42s)*: Serity company, 2 billion valuation, 300 employees.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(201.42s - 206.22s)*: And Instabase is powered by Generative AI,

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(206.22s - 208.54s)*: Adjantic Enterprise.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(208.54s - 214.78s)*: So basically, its platform intelligently analyzes structures

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(214.78s - 218.70s)*: and transform data into immediately actionable business

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(218.70s - 219.58s)*: insights.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(219.58s - 231.26s)*: so this is an end then we have ryan from assembly so ryan has a real diverse knowledge his ai

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(231.90s - 238.86s)*: has applied to modern enterprise for customer support applications he talked primarily to

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(238.86s - 246.94s)*: chief customer officers and support operation leaders this company founded in 2018 who were

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(246.94s - 249.42s)*: for AI support agents on work for planning

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(249.42s - 252.28s)*: for hundreds of other enterprises,

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(252.28s - 255.72s)*: including NC, Robin Hood, and Stripe.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(255.72s - 259.72s)*: And Ryan starts,

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(261.50s - 265.64s)*: Ryan is the head of growth at Rising Team,

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(265.64s - 268.28s)*: a company helping enterprise organizations

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(268.28s - 272.20s)*: like Google Cloud, Airbnb, Cisco, Visa,

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(272.20s - 281.00s)*: and more help their managers use AI to improve their leadership and develop stronger, more

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(281.00s - 282.00s)*: connected tips.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(282.00s - 287.44s)*: So what I really like about this session is that we are going to tackle also the strategic

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(287.44s - 292.88s)*: level and not only the band aid of AI.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(292.88s - 298.26s)*: So let's start with Amant.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(298.26s - 305.26s)*: So you have an extensive experience in the financial industry, but not only in government as well.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(305.26s - 312.26s)*: And I'm sure that you have tons of insights to share and use case and learning.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(312.26s - 316.26s)*: So how do you want to start? To you.

**Anant Barwaj** *(316.26s - 319.26s)*: Thank you. It's great to be here, Anthony.

**Anant Barwaj** *(319.26s - 324.26s)*: I think, so first I'll give you a brief overview of what we do.

**Anant Barwaj** *(324.26s - 328.26s)*: So our goal is how we can help.

**Anant Barwaj** *(328.26s - 338.26s)*: Our district does play an important role in automating many of the things that are being done either manually or not being done effectively.

**Anant Barwaj** *(338.26s - 340.26s)*: I'll give you several examples.

**Anant Barwaj** *(340.26s - 342.26s)*: So let's say you're at a bank.

**Anant Barwaj** *(342.26s - 347.26s)*: When you apply for loan, the reason why they take several days or weeks to process it is because they have to process for the data,

**Anant Barwaj** *(347.26s - 351.02s)*: and they have to do a lot of those things.

**Anant Barwaj** *(351.02s - 354.84s)*: If you go file your taxes, if you go apply for immigration,

**Anant Barwaj** *(354.84s - 356.88s)*: if you go apply for insurance claims,

**Anant Barwaj** *(356.88s - 358.94s)*: all of these things take long period of time

**Anant Barwaj** *(358.94s - 361.54s)*: because traditionally, most of those

**Anant Barwaj** *(361.54s - 365.24s)*: have been done manually because there was not enough

**Anant Barwaj** *(365.24s - 367.40s)*: intelligence in AI systems that they

**Anant Barwaj** *(367.40s - 370.44s)*: would process these complicated, sophisticated,

**Anant Barwaj** *(370.44s - 372.58s)*: unstructured data automatically.

**Anant Barwaj** *(372.58s - 375.68s)*: So our goal is how we can enable these organizations,

**Anant Barwaj** *(375.68s - 379.68s)*: take these data, process them automatically, and help them make decisions.

**Anant Barwaj** *(379.68s - 386.68s)*: The examples could be if JPMorgan wants to give you a loan in less than 10 minutes,

**Anant Barwaj** *(386.68s - 389.68s)*: now it is possible that you can do most of the things.

**Anant Barwaj** *(389.68s - 392.68s)*: Or if you want to open an account, or if you want to get insurance claims,

**Anant Barwaj** *(392.68s - 398.68s)*: or if you want to apply for immigration, these things should be doable in 5-10-15 minutes.

**Anant Barwaj** *(398.68s - 400.68s)*: They should not be taking weeks.

**Anant Barwaj** *(400.68s - 402.68s)*: So that's what we do.

**Anant Barwaj** *(402.68s - 408.68s)*: Now, question is what we have learned and what are the key insights to share.

**Anant Barwaj** *(408.68s - 411.68s)*: The key lessons are first, I think I'm very, very bullish on AI.

**Anant Barwaj** *(411.68s - 422.68s)*: I think AI will play a key role and very important role in fundamentally changing the operational productivity of every single organization, every single industry in the world.

**Anant Barwaj** *(422.68s - 427.68s)*: So I'm very, very excited. Now, at the same time, how we approach it is critically important.

**Anant Barwaj** *(427.68s - 433.68s)*: We think a bunch of these workflows that we run for lending or healthcare or for government,

**Anant Barwaj** *(433.68s - 436.68s)*: you want to make sure that if you run second time you get the same result.

**Anant Barwaj** *(436.68s - 442.68s)*: Your complete reproducibility, complete predictability, complete determinism,

**Anant Barwaj** *(442.68s - 446.68s)*: that you make sure that it's not acting differently if you run three different times.

**Anant Barwaj** *(446.68s - 451.68s)*: Those are important. I'll get to more technical details later, but our focus is how do you AI

**Anant Barwaj** *(451.68s - 457.68s)*: so that you can rely on these systems to really handle production-level workflows.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(457.68s - 482.14s)*: Thank you, Raylan. And Raylan, would love you to take also in terms of AI engines and customers' reports being the most impactful in terms of automation or human in-loop augmentation or something else. What can you share with us first?

**Ryan Wong** *(482.14s - 489.14s)*: Yeah, I think very similar takeaways to what Anon was sharing about workflow automation.

**Ryan Wong** *(489.14s - 493.14s)*: I think right now customer service is one of the most obvious.

**Ryan Wong** *(493.14s - 500.14s)*: You take the AI camera and you hit the customer service nail and automate everything away.

**Ryan Wong** *(500.14s - 505.14s)*: My background is machine learning. I worked at Stripe on fraud detection actually.

**Ryan Wong** *(505.14s - 511.14s)*: And the reason I'm working in customer service was back when it was ML or big data even, not AI.

**Ryan Wong** *(511.14s - 513.14s)*: It was like, let's go automate this away.

**Ryan Wong** *(513.14s - 520.14s)*: And then if you go do that and you go fly and maybe you handle a lot of the trivial simple tickets, like 20, 30% of that.

**Ryan Wong** *(520.14s - 522.14s)*: And then there's still a lot left.

**Ryan Wong** *(522.14s - 525.14s)*: And I think everybody has had that experience with customer support.

**Ryan Wong** *(525.14s - 527.14s)*: Okay, no, that does not solve my problem.

**Ryan Wong** *(527.14s - 530.14s)*: Hit me to a person, like right now, right?

**Ryan Wong** *(530.14s - 540.00s)*: So I think it's actually quite nuanced, the deployment in customer service, even with what's happening with AI is quite different from ML.

**Ryan Wong** *(540.00s - 543.86s)*: And there's automation of tier one support, for sure.

**Ryan Wong** *(544.50s - 547.54s)*: There's a lot of productivity gains for tier two and tier three support.

**Ryan Wong** *(547.70s - 554.88s)*: Like humans are getting better, copilots are making them more productive, taking away toilsome manual work.

**Ryan Wong** *(555.80s - 557.50s)*: And then there's also AI in the planning.

**Ryan Wong** *(557.50s - 565.30s)*: So some of what Assemble does is like both the AI automation for end consumers, but also DoorDash is one of our customers.

**Ryan Wong** *(565.46s - 572.40s)*: They have 15,000 people in the contact center, and there's very deep questions around like how many people should be working,

**Ryan Wong** *(572.52s - 575.26s)*: what should they be working on, this kind of like matching of supply and demand.

**Ryan Wong** *(575.40s - 582.98s)*: So I actually think like the use case in customer service is quite nuanced and it is this interesting blueprint for the rest of the enterprise too.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(582.98s - 608.98s)*: Thank you Ryan. And to you Ryan, but more this time on the leadership side, I would love to have your take. Most Gen.AI tools end to atomic tasks, as we mentioned, and even with family place roles. How is Rising Team using AI to actually strengthen our manager?

**Speaker 6** *(608.98s - 625.24s)*: Well thanks, Geraldine. I'm excited for this conversation. We're really thinking about the operating system and there's the technical level, there's how we plan, but then there's a little human level of how we incorporate this technology and also how the workforce has changed.

**Speaker 6** *(625.24s - 637.88s)*: So I know there's a lot of solo entrepreneurs out there, but how many folks in the audience work on a team? Either a manager or a team member? Who would say it's easier today to work on a team?

**Speaker 6** *(638.98s - 641.98s)*: Who would say it's harder?

**Speaker 6** *(641.98s - 650.98s)*: A mix of both, but certainly folks that appreciate how difficult it is.

**Speaker 6** *(650.98s - 652.98s)*: It's always been hard.

**Speaker 6** *(652.98s - 653.98s)*: What's that?

**Speaker 6** *(653.98s - 654.98s)*: It's always been hard.

**Speaker 6** *(654.98s - 658.98s)*: The truth is it's always been hard, and it's getting even harder, right?

**Speaker 6** *(658.98s - 663.98s)*: With remote work or your teams are distributed, sometimes they're halfway across the globe.

**Speaker 6** *(663.98s - 673.26s)*: So many organizations and large enterprises today have also gone through significant cost-cutting initiatives as well, so trim management layers.

**Speaker 6** *(673.84s - 680.78s)*: And so the ratio of the manager to team members is actually much higher today, higher in terms of team members.

**Speaker 6** *(681.72s - 686.96s)*: So the way that you lead a team is just very, very difficult.

**Speaker 6** *(686.96s - 694.96s)*: And really, for enterprises, the way that they're going to deliver on their strategy

**Speaker 6** *(694.96s - 697.96s)*: and their goals is having really high performing teams.

**Speaker 6** *(697.96s - 702.96s)*: And there's a lot of science behind the rationale of having teams that are very highly connected

**Speaker 6** *(702.96s - 706.96s)*: and engaged and how that actually unlocks higher team performance.

**Speaker 6** *(706.96s - 711.96s)*: But in circumstances where it's really hard today, there's new approaches that are needed.

**Speaker 6** *(711.96s - 715.96s)*: And so if you're a manager and want to build a really deeply connected team,

**Speaker 6** *(715.96s - 722.96s)*: You need to know your teammates, you need to understand their work preferences, you need to tailor your management style.

**Speaker 6** *(722.96s - 729.96s)*: Then doing that for a global distributed workforce and with your manager and your new team members,

**Speaker 6** *(729.96s - 731.96s)*: the task is going really hard.

**Speaker 6** *(731.96s - 737.96s)*: And so this is where there's opportunity for AI to help supercharge a manager

**Speaker 6** *(737.96s - 743.96s)*: by actually incorporating insights about their team members and personalizing their interactions.

**Speaker 6** *(743.96s - 751.08s)*: And so understanding how to deliver feedback to a specific team member and then when you're delivering feedback to another team,

**Speaker 6** *(751.16s - 753.98s)*: you're actually tailoring your approach to be more effective.

**Speaker 6** *(754.76s - 757.90s)*: And it's hard for managers to remember details about team members.

**Speaker 6** *(758.56s - 761.30s)*: You might have new folks coming on your team and they're to ramp up time.

**Speaker 6** *(761.66s - 771.04s)*: So this is where there's a lot of opportunity for AI to empower managers, make them more effective in how they're managing, and then do that at scale.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(771.04s - 783.04s)*: Okay, awesome. Ryan, what are the most common friction points when enterprises deploy AI

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(783.04s - 791.04s)*: engines? And of course, the one million questions, how can they be avoided?

**Ryan Wong** *(791.04s - 797.04s)*: I would be curious for other people to weigh on this too. One of the things that we see

**Ryan Wong** *(797.04s - 804.40s)*: point is that it's so obvious that customer service should be disrupted by AI that people

**Ryan Wong** *(804.40s - 811.04s)*: don't know what to actually do. I was in Barcelona two weeks ago talking to actually somebody

**Ryan Wong** *(811.04s - 815.60s)*: who was this very sophisticated support leader. She was with DoorDash very early on, now at a

**Ryan Wong** *(815.60s - 820.48s)*: company called Snunu. It's a delivery app in the Middle East. It was a billion dollar fundraise

**Ryan Wong** *(820.48s - 822.28s)*: out of Qatar.

**Ryan Wong** *(823.86s - 824.56s)*: And she was like,

**Ryan Wong** *(824.68s - 826.48s)*: our whole executive team, we know,

**Ryan Wong** *(827.12s - 828.04s)*: you've got to have AI.

**Ryan Wong** *(828.88s - 830.04s)*: Right now, yesterday.

**Ryan Wong** *(830.46s - 832.84s)*: You've got to have it right now. What does that actually mean?

**Ryan Wong** *(833.36s - 834.70s)*: And she's like, our whole

**Ryan Wong** *(834.70s - 836.80s)*: C-suite, these are senior leaders

**Ryan Wong** *(836.80s - 838.12s)*: and we keep hearing about AI,

**Ryan Wong** *(838.70s - 840.52s)*: and we don't really have time to come to conferences

**Ryan Wong** *(840.52s - 842.22s)*: like this and get deep and understand

**Ryan Wong** *(842.22s - 843.50s)*: what's really going on.

**Ryan Wong** *(844.00s - 846.74s)*: It's so far away to know how does it actually

**Ryan Wong** *(846.74s - 848.26s)*: work, let alone

**Ryan Wong** *(848.26s - 850.00s)*: what can it actually do.

**Ryan Wong** *(850.00s - 854.94s)*: And so in customer service, you've got like every single week there's a new company and they raise a shit ton of money.

**Ryan Wong** *(855.08s - 856.72s)*: And then it's like, okay, they do this thing.

**Ryan Wong** *(856.78s - 858.08s)*: And it's like, does it actually work?

**Ryan Wong** *(859.30s - 860.58s)*: You know, what are the results?

**Ryan Wong** *(860.82s - 865.14s)*: So the simple thing is like, I think people know that they want AI.

**Ryan Wong** *(865.64s - 868.72s)*: They don't know exactly what that means or how to do it, I find.

**Ryan Wong** *(868.80s - 877.22s)*: And so like, we've spent a lot of time at Assembled investing in almost like a 201, like not 101 level education, 102 level education, but like 201.

**Ryan Wong** *(877.22s - 881.42s)*: You know, like the survey of like, okay, but we're going to do a class where we're like,

**Ryan Wong** *(881.64s - 884.38s)*: explain to you, like, and not just like networking dinners.

**Ryan Wong** *(884.48s - 889.34s)*: Like we're going to get like five executives of customer service together, do a 201 survey

**Ryan Wong** *(889.34s - 894.20s)*: of like, okay, here's all the different use cases we've seen of like pure automation,

**Ryan Wong** *(894.90s - 903.36s)*: AI agents for chat, for email, for voice, co-pilots, quality assurance, co-pilot for

**Ryan Wong** *(903.36s - 904.46s)*: like workflow automation.

**Ryan Wong** *(904.46s - 907.04s)*: Like, okay, here's how it integrates with like RPA too.

**Ryan Wong** *(907.04s - 910.80s)*: robotic process automation, something that's a little bit older, all the way into workforce

**Ryan Wong** *(910.80s - 915.52s)*: management, forecasting, so really giving people the landscape of, okay, these are things that you

**Ryan Wong** *(916.40s - 921.84s)*: know about, like you get specific problems, and here's how it ties to this like firm role,

**Ryan Wong** *(921.84s - 926.72s)*: so the full survey, but I think it really, I mean, again, I'm curious if other people see that,

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(926.72s - 933.60s)*: it's like, what is AI actually? Yeah, thank you, thank you so much. And I would love to have you

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(933.60s - 938.48s)*: take on this because you have been you are one of the pioneers working on that

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(938.48s - 946.18s)*: for eight years and now so obviously you are you could you could attest of the

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(946.18s - 953.76s)*: curve of innovation and maturity of everything so what in terms of your

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(953.76s - 959.04s)*: learning that this use case what do you want to share with us to to provide value

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(959.04s - 961.28s)*: to our origins?

**Anant Barwaj** *(961.28s - 963.18s)*: Yeah, maybe I think it would make sense

**Anant Barwaj** *(963.18s - 964.88s)*: to take two different perspectives.

**Anant Barwaj** *(964.88s - 966.98s)*: One, I'll take one technical perspective,

**Anant Barwaj** *(966.98s - 969.66s)*: and the second is .

**Anant Barwaj** *(969.66s - 972.08s)*: So technical perspective, I think if you look at the user

**Anant Barwaj** *(972.08s - 975.92s)*: of AI, I break that into roughly, I think,

**Anant Barwaj** *(975.92s - 977.62s)*: four different levels.

**Anant Barwaj** *(977.62s - 981.36s)*: The first one is people going to JackGPT or cloud

**Anant Barwaj** *(981.36s - 982.26s)*: and asking some questions.

**Anant Barwaj** *(982.26s - 984.66s)*: That's the first level of productivity.

**Anant Barwaj** *(984.66s - 986.44s)*: But if you want to do it on your own data,

**Anant Barwaj** *(986.44s - 988.26s)*: it would be trained on internet data.

**Anant Barwaj** *(988.26s - 997.86s)*: So second level, I think, of sophistication, what I've seen is some kind of rag where people connect it with their systems and it will do some retrieval from your stuff and then get you an answer.

**Anant Barwaj** *(998.70s - 1006.02s)*: Third level of sophistication that I've seen now work reasonably well in some places is kind of like the tool augmented rag.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1006.12s - 1013.12s)*: So you're not just retrieving, but you are taking some actions like query database and pulling stuff from Salesforce and doing those kind of things.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1013.70s - 1015.86s)*: But still, I call this like tool augmented rag.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1015.86s - 1020.86s)*: And I've seen those people have done some kind of small small things around these three areas.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1020.86s - 1027.86s)*: The next two is much more nuanced, which is, and I think that's what Ryan was talking about, the first, number four, which I call AI workflow.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1027.86s - 1033.86s)*: AI workflow is a set of steps where AI can assist in those things, but who does the reasoning?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1033.86s - 1039.86s)*: Who defines what should happen? And the last one is agentic, which you all must have heard.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1039.86s - 1048.50s)*: So I have some controversy to take on the technical part of this, which is I do not believe that agentics should run in production.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1049.18s - 1051.16s)*: And the reason for that is the following.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1051.86s - 1061.32s)*: Even if you're running an organization, right, not a human or a support person sitting on the, you know, branch desk or branch table make a decision based on what they think.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1061.40s - 1062.12s)*: They don't, right?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1062.12s - 1064.08s)*: They make based on defined protocol.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1064.26s - 1068.56s)*: They follow the exact set of steps that somebody has to do as a process in the company.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1068.56s - 1074.12s)*: Like if you want to some, you know, a person and then steps in and decide whether he should get it out or not, right?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1074.12s - 1076.50s)*: They basically go, submit, they run a bunch of things.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1076.72s - 1084.04s)*: And so I think that the reality is the way I see technically things will get deployed is

**Anant Barwaj** *(1084.04s - 1087.68s)*: agency could play an important role in helping you create these workflows,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1087.88s - 1091.98s)*: but then humans would come and decide which steps make sense, which steps do not make sense,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1092.08s - 1095.76s)*: which steps require human review, which steps require rejection checks,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1095.76s - 1100.50s)*: which steps basically need to be validated in a certain way or whatever.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1100.94s - 1105.46s)*: But once that is created, then you have, that generates like more deterministic workflow,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1105.92s - 1107.38s)*: which runs in production.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1108.12s - 1111.24s)*: Typically, it's always a good idea to take lessons from what has worked well.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1111.44s - 1117.26s)*: And I think one tool that I've been reasonably impressed with is some of these coding tools.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1117.40s - 1121.48s)*: You might have used Cursor or Windsor and some of those, and I use them a lot.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1121.86s - 1124.96s)*: But you don't allow agent to go write code in person production, right?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1124.96s - 1131.02s)*: It didn't work that way. You ask the agent to create those, but then you go review, you maintain, you test it, and everything looks good.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1131.28s - 1134.12s)*: Then you put something that is much more deterministic, which is a production.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1134.42s - 1143.80s)*: So our approach is that agent-to-KI would be more of build and development time phenomena that will allow you to create a bunch of work projects here.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1144.20s - 1152.76s)*: But run-time phenomena is going to be AI work-world, which would be much more predictable, deterministic, explainable, instrumentable, and so on.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1152.76s - 1171.06s)*: So we have taken a very clear stand that we will use authentic in human AI collaboration only during build or development time, never in production. And production will be AI workflow. But AI should play an important role in key steps, but with much more checks and balances in place.

**Ryan Wong** *(1171.06s - 1176.94s)*: I'm curious, I like your breakdown of the different levels of AI understanding.

**Ryan Wong** *(1176.94s - 1179.82s)*: Where do you think most of your customers are?

**Ryan Wong** *(1179.82s - 1183.70s)*: Are they at the sophistication of the different...

**Ryan Wong** *(1183.70s - 1185.82s)*: Do they understand the distinction of agentic?

**Ryan Wong** *(1185.82s - 1190.38s)*: Or is it at the level one, like, okay, how's this different from Chai Chabiti?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1190.38s - 1193.38s)*: Yeah, so I think the...

**Anant Barwaj** *(1193.38s - 1196.38s)*: No, so basically you have to tell them.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1196.38s - 1197.38s)*: Because what is agentic?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1197.38s - 1201.38s)*: And if you ask 10 different people, they will give you 10 different answers.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1201.38s - 1203.38s)*: So we also have a very clear definition of what agentic.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1203.38s - 1209.38s)*: Agentic is just think of a magical function where you give your goal and set of tools, and that's it. Nothing else.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1209.38s - 1216.38s)*: AI should be able to autonomously be able to figure out how to use these tools and how to check it, how to correct it,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1216.38s - 1221.38s)*: how to do whatever, retract from some mistakes and all that kind of stuff and do it.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1221.38s - 1226.38s)*: And this is very, very powerful, right? Like you just give a goal instead of tools and you should be able to figure everything out.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1226.38s - 1228.38s)*: But that comes with a ton of dangers, right?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1228.38s - 1230.38s)*: What if it uses the tool in the wrong way?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1230.38s - 1232.38s)*: What if some tools can have some side effects?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1232.38s - 1236.38s)*: So in general, I think you can play an important role,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1236.38s - 1242.38s)*: but those simple goals and tools should be used to generate what I will run in production.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1242.38s - 1245.38s)*: This will be run on some test and sandbox data set that is human groups,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1245.38s - 1250.38s)*: and then ask what the checkboxes, and then you define a predictable workflow, and then you run it.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1250.38s - 1253.38s)*: So I think where most of the customers are, once you're passing directly,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1253.38s - 1271.08s)*: Most of them are still like the production deployment that I have seen is classic like rag or tool oriented rag a little bit. That's where people say we are, if you look at every few weeks there is a blog by JP Morgan and Goldman that we are now doing this with AI.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1271.08s - 1273.48s)*: The crypto is some simple drag system, right?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1273.48s - 1276.68s)*: Like somebody's doing some query on some data that they're indexed.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1276.68s - 1284.58s)*: And I think that we have seen agentic primarily encoding.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1284.58s - 1286.58s)*: That's where we've seen some stuff.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1286.58s - 1288.38s)*: The workflow area is fully open.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1288.38s - 1293.58s)*: Whoever figures out the best way to do it, that's a massive, like, I think, trillion dollar market.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1293.58s - 1305.58s)*: So whoever figures out like what is the entire life cycle of workflow creation and production running of those workflows reliably, that's a trillion dollar market.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1305.58s - 1308.58s)*: Yes, thank you. Thank you, Ellen.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1308.58s - 1314.58s)*: And for sure, human control through the process is super, super important.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1314.58s - 1319.58s)*: and this is a majority of agent tech AI.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1320.60s - 1325.60s)*: But I love your way of picking up our awareness

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1328.46s - 1329.68s)*: on the topic.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1329.68s - 1333.70s)*: Ryan, because you are close to the strategy of company,

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1333.70s - 1336.46s)*: and I think the answer might be there,

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1336.46s - 1339.16s)*: the closer you are to the strategy of the company,

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1339.16s - 1343.08s)*: in the end, and you make sure that the tech

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1343.08s - 1346.64s)*: is really a tool to the service of the strategy,

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1346.64s - 1349.72s)*: which is a winning answer.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1349.72s - 1354.72s)*: So for you, can you share an example of large enterprise

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1356.12s - 1359.16s)*: with really moving out Gen.AI

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1359.16s - 1361.20s)*: for team development at scale,

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1361.20s - 1364.08s)*: at scale on what impact they are seeing?

**Ryan Starks** *(1364.08s - 1366.24s)*: So let's take a look.

**Ryan Starks** *(1366.24s - 1367.52s)*: Yeah, absolutely.

**Speaker 6** *(1367.52s - 1369.32s)*: Like I said, I just said, too,

**Speaker 6** *(1369.32s - 1386.38s)*: So we've seen a spectrum of adoption in terms of, hey, there's kind of a one-on-one level of, you know, I want to learn how to use AI and start to incorporate it on a daily basis versus actually getting more of like a two-on-one level of like, okay, how is it going to change my behavior?

**Speaker 6** *(1386.38s - 1388.38s)*: How can I lead differently?

**Speaker 6** *(1388.38s - 1392.38s)*: So we certainly see a spectrum of that development.

**Speaker 6** *(1392.38s - 1398.38s)*: One of our customers, Google Cloud, has adopted our team leadership development platform

**Speaker 6** *(1398.38s - 1403.38s)*: and the AI coaching aspect across a lot of engineering and cloud teams.

**Speaker 6** *(1403.38s - 1408.38s)*: And the way that they implement it has aligned with their strategy

**Speaker 6** *(1408.38s - 1412.38s)*: around building more trust with teams, building more connectedness.

**Speaker 6** *(1412.38s - 1419.38s)*: So they're actually running experiences usually on a quarterly basis as a team, with a group,

**Speaker 6** *(1419.38s - 1422.38s)*: building more connectivity and team skills.

**Speaker 6** *(1422.38s - 1430.38s)*: The insights from those sessions are then incorporated into the AI coach that then managers and team members can access on a daily basis.

**Speaker 6** *(1430.38s - 1437.38s)*: And so what we've seen is that by running more sessions and incorporating that feedback is you can drive up manager effectiveness scores,

**Speaker 6** *(1437.38s - 1442.86s)*: scores, you can drive up engagement, you can drive up connectedness and trust.

**Speaker 6** *(1442.86s - 1450.92s)*: And so we see overall team engagement scores go by 60 to 200%, which is very significant

**Speaker 6** *(1450.92s - 1457.02s)*: and that can be driven by a manager specifically dialing in what they need to focus on, whether

**Speaker 6** *(1457.02s - 1461.64s)*: it's improving feedback on their team or helping with resilience versus implementing something

**Speaker 6** *(1461.64s - 1462.38s)*: that's very generic.

**Speaker 6** *(1462.66s - 1466.84s)*: So the AI can then actually learn what the team needs.

**Speaker 6** *(1466.84s - 1478.60s)*: So based on what team members are saying, different feedback they're providing, the AI can then guide the manager to focus on a specific skill area or focus area for the team the next quarter.

**Speaker 6** *(1479.64s - 1489.76s)*: And so it becomes, whereas engagement surveys have become very generic, and teams have also gone through different corporate trainings,

**Ryan Starks** *(1489.76s - 1494.22s)*: This can actually provide a very customized approach based on the team and the manager

**Ryan Starks** *(1494.22s - 1497.08s)*: and the focus, which helps track with results.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1497.60s - 1498.70s)*: Ryan, can I ask you a question?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1500.00s - 1503.50s)*: So this is something, I don't know what you both run the company,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1503.66s - 1509.86s)*: but I have seen in the last 10 to 12 months, mainly in the last six months,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1510.62s - 1516.92s)*: now the fundamental difference that AI makes between, let's say, a good software engineer,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1516.92s - 1522.92s)*: I was like, okay software engineering and great software engineering is no longer 10x or 50x, maybe 10x.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1522.92s - 1529.92s)*: Because with tools like this that were agonizing code, like really really good people are able to get so much done so quickly.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1529.92s - 1540.92s)*: I find that a lot of the managers and leaders basically, they just add the bulk and slow everybody down rather than adding to other values.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1540.92s - 1544.86s)*: I think, what is the new organizational structure in the AI?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1544.86s - 1546.88s)*: I think the managers should be fired.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1546.88s - 1549.86s)*: That's what I think about the question.

**Speaker 6** *(1549.86s - 1551.36s)*: It's a really provocative question.

**Speaker 6** *(1551.36s - 1555.24s)*: But yeah, the trend of organizations getting thinner,

**Speaker 6** *(1555.24s - 1557.86s)*: a manager being able to manage across more teams.

**Speaker 6** *(1557.86s - 1559.72s)*: And then to your point, the productivity

**Speaker 6** *(1559.72s - 1564.66s)*: of an individual engineer could be 100x what was in the past.

**Speaker 6** *(1564.66s - 1568.94s)*: So very much can also just change the interactions

**Speaker 6** *(1568.94s - 1575.94s)*: between team members or functional collaboration versus the vertical orientation as well.

**Ryan Wong** *(1575.94s - 1584.94s)*: I'll take the other side of this. I agree. The gains to somebody being really effective

**Ryan Wong** *(1584.94s - 1589.94s)*: with tools are larger than ever so you see more kind of like dispersion between the top

**Ryan Wong** *(1589.94s - 1595.94s)*: and the bottom. And I even saw like a code review come in from our team who was out at

**Ryan Wong** *(1595.94s - 1599.78s)*: and somebody put in a pull request through Codex.

**Ryan Wong** *(1599.78s - 1601.90s)*: I was like, that's awesome.

**Ryan Wong** *(1601.90s - 1603.88s)*: I didn't know exactly who that is.

**Ryan Wong** *(1603.88s - 1606.66s)*: But I think that, if anything, ironically,

**Ryan Wong** *(1606.66s - 1608.48s)*: that made bank management even more important,

**Ryan Wong** *(1608.48s - 1610.14s)*: because there is this huge correlation

**Ryan Wong** *(1610.14s - 1612.42s)*: between the top managers and the bottom managers.

**Ryan Wong** *(1612.42s - 1614.46s)*: Like, you see attrition tied to it.

**Ryan Wong** *(1614.46s - 1616.52s)*: You see unhappiness tied to it.

**Ryan Wong** *(1616.52s - 1619.42s)*: We went a year and a half without running a bull survey,

**Ryan Wong** *(1619.42s - 1621.50s)*: and we're actually about to do it again.

**Ryan Wong** *(1621.50s - 1623.84s)*: And I think it is because, like, oh, you know,

**Ryan Wong** *(1623.84s - 1626.48s)*: like what was holding us back before wasn't necessarily

**Ryan Wong** *(1626.48s - 1628.00s)*: we don't want to know what people think

**Ryan Wong** *(1628.00s - 1629.88s)*: and we don't want to give that information to managers.

**Ryan Wong** *(1629.88s - 1632.40s)*: It was like, well, we might not have the bandwidth

**Ryan Wong** *(1632.40s - 1633.24s)*: to act on it.

**Ryan Wong** *(1633.24s - 1635.38s)*: And I do think managers have a really important role

**Ryan Wong** *(1635.38s - 1637.08s)*: in the world where, like, yeah,

**Ryan Wong** *(1637.08s - 1639.24s)*: you don't need to have like 15 to one,

**Ryan Wong** *(1639.24s - 1641.56s)*: 10 to one, 20 to one or whatever ratios.

**Ryan Wong** *(1641.56s - 1643.92s)*: Like, yeah, spend some really close time together

**Ryan Wong** *(1643.92s - 1646.24s)*: with the best people you're talking about.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1646.24s - 1647.96s)*: The question I think,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1647.96s - 1649.36s)*: the engagement survey and post survey,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1649.36s - 1652.18s)*: those are more of the trading indicators.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1652.18s - 1658.42s)*: So I think the key question is, given that inequality is going to widen in a significant way,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1658.42s - 1663.14s)*: I think the managers might have a hard time knowing how do you handle such inequality?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1663.14s - 1668.18s)*: In the performance review, you're like, yeah, somebody performed 40% more, 5% more.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1668.18s - 1671.18s)*: Now the difference that you see is just insane.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1671.18s - 1680.18s)*: And what is the way to get effective outcome but still keep people in a good place?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1680.18s - 1685.18s)*: Is it a balance that you understand?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1685.18s - 1687.18s)*: No.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1687.18s - 1689.18s)*: Not a disciple.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1689.18s - 1692.18s)*: If you can get on that, but then.

**Speaker 6** *(1692.18s - 1697.18s)*: I was going to say that I think the pace of change in every organization is just accelerating.

**Speaker 6** *(1697.18s - 1704.18s)*: And so building the capacity and resilience for whether you're a manager or a team member,

**Speaker 6** *(1704.18s - 1708.18s)*: just to be able to absorb and react and respond to that whole change.

**Speaker 6** *(1708.18s - 1715.18s)*: I think he's also a skill that's really needed and will continue to be needed in this space.

**Ryan Wong** *(1715.18s - 1719.18s)*: I can tell you one of the really specific things that we chartered our managers with

**Ryan Wong** *(1719.18s - 1723.18s)*: and that we've also told our customers that they should have their management layers.

**Ryan Wong** *(1723.18s - 1726.18s)*: And granted there's a difference between Assemble and our customers.

**Ryan Wong** *(1726.18s - 1730.18s)*: Our customers are running large support teams and we're a technology company

**Ryan Wong** *(1730.18s - 1732.18s)*: so I think there's a little different of a need.

**Ryan Wong** *(1732.18s - 1737.18s)*: But I think for all of them it's like figure out how to help your team make AI specific.

**Ryan Wong** *(1737.18s - 1744.90s)*: So I found that I have to keep up every three months, every two months, oh, now you're able

**Ryan Wong** *(1744.90s - 1750.58s)*: to do codecs, you don't have to just do cursor where you're sitting there at the computer,

**Ryan Wong** *(1750.58s - 1752.62s)*: you just drop it into your mobile phone.

**Ryan Wong** *(1752.62s - 1756.46s)*: It's really hard to keep up, and I think the really great managers are helping their teams

**Ryan Wong** *(1756.46s - 1757.46s)*: keep up.

**Ryan Wong** *(1757.46s - 1761.20s)*: And in support, it's like, okay, this is what your role is going to look like six months

**Ryan Wong** *(1761.20s - 1762.20s)*: from now.

**Ryan Wong** *(1762.20s - 1766.70s)*: By the way, if you use GPT-03 instead of 4-0, that's going to help you a lot.

**Ryan Wong** *(1766.70s - 1769.70s)*: So that's something we specifically try to manage.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1769.70s - 1776.70s)*: Yes, and I see the manager has a more and more competitive role to them, and that's the point.

**Ryan Starks** *(1776.70s - 1782.70s)*: And most of the managers are not that sensible because we have time to change so fast

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1782.70s - 1789.70s)*: that they need to keep up with the learning, which is quite different with the tech, which is different.

**Ryan Starks** *(1789.70s - 1796.70s)*: So it's more about what we need in terms of skills for that new manager who is able to

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1796.70s - 1804.70s)*: get the insights from his team and the leader for labor but still have an impact at the

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1804.70s - 1806.70s)*: leadership of our role.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1806.70s - 1816.70s)*: So for sure it's a new topic and upskilling manager is one very important topic.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1816.70s - 1827.10s)*: we are going through the end i would love to have your your perspective about what you see coming

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1827.10s - 1835.90s)*: in the next few months so changing our our perspective by looking forward um i bet maybe

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1835.90s - 1845.58s)*: you were there last year on stage maybe sharing and you see how much it has been so fast and the

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1845.58s - 1850.24s)*: the maturity curve about agency, kind of AI, etc.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1850.24s - 1853.16s)*: So what is your take about what is,

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1853.16s - 1855.42s)*: what advice would you give to leaders

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(1855.42s - 1858.88s)*: the next ones based on what you think will be the future?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1860.12s - 1861.26s)*: If I would give an advice,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1861.26s - 1863.16s)*: I'll give something different.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1863.16s - 1866.22s)*: Advice would be that AI will play an important role.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1866.22s - 1867.56s)*: It will change everything,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1867.56s - 1869.82s)*: it doesn't make everyone other functions.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1869.82s - 1873.32s)*: So do not fight it, get along with it.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1873.32s - 1874.48s)*: By making it for you.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1874.48s - 1879.48s)*: I think in terms of the future, just the same question.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1879.48s - 1884.48s)*: I was thinking, this is a part of my mind, I was trying to play with the system.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1884.48s - 1888.48s)*: Basically, I was looking at that how do you get value from computers?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1888.48s - 1894.48s)*: The way you get value from computers is by your eyes, you see things, and you input things by your hand, right?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1894.48s - 1896.48s)*: The mouse and keyboard.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1896.48s - 1904.48s)*: I think that maybe the next most powerful AI would not be based on tokens and those kind of things.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1904.48s - 1909.48s)*: It should just see things and operate keyboard and mouse.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1909.48s - 1913.48s)*: If you can do that, it will give you everything computing has to offer.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1913.48s - 1920.48s)*: So I think that I'm sure that future AI would not look like maybe the current AI the way it looks.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1920.48s - 1923.48s)*: If you want to do real agent, then maybe like,

**Anant Barwaj** *(1923.48s - 1925.98s)*: it should be a replacement of human body models, right?

**Anant Barwaj** *(1925.98s - 1928.98s)*: With your hand and fingers that you use for

**Anant Barwaj** *(1928.98s - 1931.98s)*: operating the mouse and then you can do that.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1931.98s - 1933.98s)*: I'm going to continue there.

**Anant Barwaj** *(1933.98s - 1936.98s)*: So we will see that when that now the idea comes.

**Ryan Starks** *(1939.48s - 1942.98s)*: Awesome. And we have a few minutes for questions.

**Ryan Wong** *(1942.98s - 1945.98s)*: If you guys would be willing to answer some questions.

**Ryan Wong** *(1945.98s - 1947.98s)*: But of course I want to give you some time

**Ryan Wong** *(1947.98s - 1949.98s)*: to share your final takeaways.

**Ryan Wong** *(1949.98s - 1951.98s)*: Thank you Ryan and Ryan.

**Ryan Wong** *(1953.98s - 1969.98s)*: You want to come to me? I'll just say super quickly, like this myopic topic of enterprise, I think there's a lot, what we will see in three months, six months, there's a lot less, or a lot more of the kind of like preparation for AI.

**Ryan Wong** *(1969.98s - 1970.98s)*: I'll tell you what I mean.

**Ryan Wong** *(1970.98s - 1974.82s)*: Like in customer service, the biggest slowdown of adoption

**Ryan Wong** *(1974.82s - 1978.12s)*: is just like even about being processes, not even like brag,

**Ryan Wong** *(1978.12s - 1980.30s)*: but like we didn't write anything down.

**Ryan Wong** *(1980.30s - 1982.56s)*: We don't know what the refund policy is.

**Ryan Wong** *(1982.56s - 1984.10s)*: Like it's just in somebody's head.

**Ryan Wong** *(1984.10s - 1986.30s)*: And it's just like somebody's got like a project manager

**Ryan Wong** *(1986.30s - 1988.92s)*: to go figure out like, okay, what do we actually do

**Ryan Wong** *(1988.92s - 1989.68s)*: in this situation?

**Ryan Wong** *(1989.68s - 1990.68s)*: So I'm hearing a lot of that.

**Ryan Wong** *(1990.68s - 1994.42s)*: The value of writing stuff down, writing stuff down,

**Ryan Wong** *(1994.42s - 1996.22s)*: like that's quite high.

**Ryan Wong** *(1996.22s - 1998.72s)*: I mean, I think more and more organizations are realizing,

**Ryan Wong** *(1998.72s - 2001.28s)*: Well, we've got to put this stuff down on paper

**Ryan Wong** *(2001.28s - 2002.78s)*: before we put AI into it.

**Speaker 6** *(2005.42s - 2008.22s)*: I think the biggest trend that I would see over next year

**Speaker 6** *(2008.22s - 2011.96s)*: is not looking for external tools or other platforms,

**Speaker 6** *(2011.96s - 2015.72s)*: but actually looking at where work happens in those spaces,

**Speaker 6** *(2015.72s - 2019.78s)*: whether it's on Zoom or in Slack or Microsoft Teams.

**Speaker 6** *(2019.78s - 2023.02s)*: And I see a lot of AI tools in the team building space

**Speaker 6** *(2023.02s - 2025.44s)*: kind of coming into those tools,

**Speaker 6** *(2025.44s - 2027.80s)*: rethinking how you actually build teams

**Speaker 6** *(2027.80s - 2031.22s)*: and engage employees and how you manage.

**Speaker 6** *(2031.22s - 2034.52s)*: You can imagine an AI agent understanding

**Speaker 6** *(2034.52s - 2036.38s)*: that the team resilience is really low.

**Speaker 6** *(2036.38s - 2039.12s)*: Here's how to actually coach a specific team member

**Speaker 6** *(2039.12s - 2040.84s)*: before you're one-on-one, just having that bit

**Speaker 6** *(2040.84s - 2043.74s)*: of information presented to you right in Slack.

**Speaker 6** *(2043.74s - 2045.60s)*: So I think there's a lot more kind of incorporation

**Speaker 6** *(2045.60s - 2047.56s)*: of AI into existing tools.

**Speaker 6** *(2047.56s - 2051.06s)*: You really see that happening right now.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2051.06s - 2052.90s)*: I want to add one comment to what Ryan said.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2052.90s - 2054.40s)*: The writing is so important.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2054.40s - 2056.68s)*: That is such a profound statement.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2056.68s - 2060.48s)*: there should be one takeaway from this entire panel,

**Anant Barwaj** *(2060.48s - 2062.68s)*: and that should be that part.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2062.68s - 2064.06s)*: I'll tell you why.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2064.06s - 2066.12s)*: Because there is so much money that is being spent with AI

**Anant Barwaj** *(2066.12s - 2067.94s)*: that will solve your search problem and all that.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2067.94s - 2070.36s)*: I think you're inviting that AI would not solve enterprise

**Anant Barwaj** *(2070.36s - 2071.06s)*: search.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2071.06s - 2073.12s)*: You get enterprise search is not a search for AI problem.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2073.12s - 2074.26s)*: It's a data problem.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2074.26s - 2076.30s)*: On internet, it works because you have one of the websites

**Anant Barwaj** *(2076.30s - 2079.48s)*: where people maintain a source of truth on the URL.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2079.48s - 2081.58s)*: And that's why when you search, it helps

**Anant Barwaj** *(2081.58s - 2082.88s)*: for other people in your ranking, right?

**Anant Barwaj** *(2082.88s - 2085.68s)*: Like Google, and New York Times, or CNN,

**Anant Barwaj** *(2085.68s - 2091.68s)*: on Fox, in WordPress or something else. On Enterprise, data, you search. If I search for my check-in, it gives me an answer.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2091.68s - 2097.68s)*: And everything is backwards to data, but the data is old. And I cannot say that data that is new is more trustworthy than data is old.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2097.68s - 2102.68s)*: I write about the crap stuff. You cannot say that data written by Ryan is more trustworthy than somebody else.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2102.68s - 2108.68s)*: So unless you solve data curation problem and data life cycle problem within Enterprise, search will be unsolved.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2108.68s - 2117.64s)*: and that's why writing and maintaining what is the source of truth is the most critical value gain

**Anant Barwaj** *(2117.64s - 2120.60s)*: for any enterprise if you can do that with the creation data quality well.

**Geraldine Woluk-Adami** *(2121.64s - 2126.28s)*: Yes, first. It's a clear content talk. So time for questions.

**Ryan Wong** *(2128.28s - 2132.12s)*: Yeah, we have some here in the back left. I think we have time for just one or two questions.

**Ryan Wong** *(2132.12s - 2134.12s)*: So, let's get you.

**Ryan Starks** *(2134.12s - 2137.12s)*: Hi, that's Brad Hopper.

**Ryan Starks** *(2137.12s - 2139.12s)*: I'm a self-actual.

**Ryan Starks** *(2139.12s - 2144.12s)*: Who does own the data that you're talking about, and who should own the data?

**Ryan Starks** *(2144.12s - 2146.12s)*: Is it the employee of the organization?

**Ryan Starks** *(2146.12s - 2149.12s)*: Should employees get to take it with them?

**Ryan Starks** *(2149.12s - 2151.12s)*: In what sense?

**Ryan Starks** *(2151.12s - 2153.12s)*: I mean, basically, in enterprise?

**Ryan Starks** *(2153.12s - 2155.12s)*: You're creating data about people.

**Ryan Starks** *(2155.12s - 2157.12s)*: You're pulling their thoughts into things, right?

**Ryan Starks** *(2157.12s - 2161.12s)*: There might even be future thoughts in the case of Brian, right?

**Ryan Starks** *(2161.12s - 2165.12s)*: Who should own that? Is that the organization that should own it or should people get it?

**Ryan Starks** *(2165.12s - 2169.12s)*: Is it a co-ownership? Where should it be?

**Ryan Starks** *(2169.12s - 2173.12s)*: This is like Slack locking down their API type of thing?

**Ryan Starks** *(2173.12s - 2177.12s)*: No, well, you distribute it, I guess.

**Speaker 6** *(2177.12s - 2181.12s)*: What were the questions?

**Speaker 6** *(2181.12s - 2185.12s)*: Who should own the data from a team? I can speak from

**Speaker 6** *(2185.12s - 2189.12s)*: some of the team development space. What we found is creating

**Speaker 6** *(2189.12s - 2191.18s)*: data that's useful within a team.

**Speaker 6** *(2191.18s - 2194.88s)*: And we've been very thoughtful about thinking about both safeguards

**Speaker 6** *(2194.88s - 2197.60s)*: and where should data be shared.

**Speaker 6** *(2197.60s - 2201.52s)*: We found really keeping any data or insights

**Speaker 6** *(2201.52s - 2205.28s)*: about individual team members belongs to that team

**Speaker 6** *(2205.28s - 2209.72s)*: and should not exist, kind of be shared more broadly.

**Speaker 6** *(2209.72s - 2212.58s)*: It's an active question, I think, for a lot of enterprise

**Anant Barwaj** *(2212.58s - 2215.12s)*: is what type of data is shared.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2215.12s - 2218.74s)*: So question on basically, like, from the ..

**Anant Barwaj** *(2218.74s - 2225.74s)*: we take this very simple, which is very different than the model, any data that is produced by the enterprise is owned by them, we don't own any of those.

**Anant Barwaj** *(2225.74s - 2234.74s)*: So in general, I think very, very clear, which is that any data that is produced by their people using any of our tools or any of their stuff remains on them forever.

**Ryan Wong** *(2234.74s - 2244.74s)*: Thank you so much for answering that question. And we're running low on time here, so I was actually going to ask if any of our speakers upstage would want to answer some questions on the side,

**Ryan Wong** *(2244.74s - 2251.22s)*: side for a few people if you guys have time if you're with of course yes thank you so that will

**Ryan Wong** *(2251.22s - 2257.66s)*: conclude our session here on AIXS thank you so much to our moderator Geraldine and our panelists
